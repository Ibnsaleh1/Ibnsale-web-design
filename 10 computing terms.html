        <dt>
          <br><b><li> Modem </li></b>
          </br>
        </dt>

        <dd> The word modem was originally coined in the days when computers communicated
          by converting numbers into sounds that could then be transmitted over
          a regular telephone line. At each end you needed a “modulator” to generate
          the sounds to transmit and a “demodulator” to convert received sounds
          back into numbers. From “MOdulator/DEModulator” came the word modem.

        <dt>
          <br><b><li> Virus </li></b>
          </br>
        </dt>
        <dd> A virus is a piece of software that can copy itself and which attaches
          itself to some other program in order to survive and replicate. It may
          have some malicious intent or it may exist simply to reproduce.</dd>
        <dt>
          <br><b><li> Worm </li></b>
          </br>
        </dt>
        <dd> A worm is similar to virus but it can exist independently; it doesn’t need
          to attach to a separate program. </dd>
        <dt>
          <br><b><li> Malware </li></b>
          </br>
        </dt>
        <dd> Malware is a general term for all such programs – it simply means any software,
          of whatever sort, written with a malicious intent. Viruses are generally
          malware but there is more to malware than just viruses.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <br><b><li> Firewall </li></b>
          </br>
        </dt>
        <dd> A firewall is a piece of computer software or hardware that restricts the
          data that is allowed to flow through. Firewalls block traffic that is
          undesirable in some way, the intention being to prevent infection by
          malware and so on without restricting the user from carrying out legitimate
          activity. </dd>
        <dt>
          <br><b><li> Spam  </li></b>
          </br>
        </dt>
        <dd> Unsolicited email messages sent out in bulk and generally commercial in
          nature. In fact the term is used more widely these days to refer to such
          messages in a variety of places, not just on email – for example comments
          on blogs. </dd>
        <dt>
          <br><b><li> Captcha </li></b>
          </br>
        </dt>
        <dd> CAPTCHA checks are the strings of letters and numbers that have to be typed
          in on some web pages before something can be saved. They exist because,
          although humans find interpreting these strings relatively easy, computers
          do not. Setting up these checks therefore blocks an automated process
          – such as one generating spam – from using the page, whereas a human
          is still able to.The acronym CAPTCHA actually stands for “Completely
          Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart” – a
          rather contrived way of arriving at an acronym that sounds like the word
          “capture”. </dd>
        <dt>
          <br><b><li> Cookie </li></b>
          </br>
        </dt>
        <dd> A small text file sent to your computer by a web site you have visited.
          These can be very useful in that they can allow the web site to recognize
          who you are when you return. Cookies cannot store viruses or other threats,
          although they can be used to track your activity across different web
          sites in order to provide, for example, “targeted” advertisements.</dd>
        <dt>
          <br><b><li> Trojans </li></b>
          </br>
        </dt>
        <dd> A Trojan – or Trojan Horse – is a piece of software that gains access to
          a computer by pretending to be benign or by hiding within some innocent-looking
          application. The name is obviously derived from the wooden horse employed
          by the Greek army during the Trojan Wars. </dd>
        <dt>
          <br><b><li> Spyware </li></b>
          </br>
        </dt>
        <dd> Spyware is software that secretly monitors computer activity, attempting
          to gain private information without the computer user knowing. </dd>
